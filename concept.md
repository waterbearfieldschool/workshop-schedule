I am thinking of setting up a web page at Water Bearfield School, and this would be the single web page that would list a calendar of workshops for at least the next couple months, and the schedule would be as described below as an example. I'd like to make this web page look realistic with a working calendar which might be whatever best format can handle that and be edited easily. It should probably be a full calendar because I'm thinking about scheduling things on different days of the month, and it would be good for people to see all of the days and weeks of the month for several months, so I don't know which calendar application to use. And I would like to have the course descriptions link, the course listings on the calendar link to course descriptions that are on the same page, so it's very easy to scroll down and see. I think there will only be three or so workshop examples for now, and if you could use the Ask User Question tool to interview me about this and make a plan, that would be great.

The core ideas is that we set up a rotating series of classes each week ... Tues, Thursday at 10 AM;  Monday, Friday at 6 PM -- mostly in person, but one or more sessions a month could be virtual
intro to mesh radio
intro to diy off-grid power (maybe some weeks are more solar, some more bike)
intro to off-grid telemetry for farms, homes, schools
wildcard

place the class topics in different slots each week for the monthly schedule, to accommodate different schedules ...

hardware cost is $30 (for a radio node) if you want to purchase it
default cost for workshop is $60
if you need solidarity, it's $30
if you want to give solidarity, $90+

the locations on the schedule will be "North Waltham, TBD", or "East Somerville, TBD", but will be sent out via email to registered folks in advance of the class after they sign up;  this way we're not 'setting up shop' at a particular park, we're flexible

for the virtual sessions, you have to sign up 2 weeks in advance, and you get mailed a kit before the meeting starts
